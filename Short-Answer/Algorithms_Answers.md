#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This has a cubic O(n^3) runtime since this operation will execute n^3 amount of times.

b) This has a quadratic O(n^2) runtime since this operation will be run n amount of times for each iteration between 0 and n.

c) This has a linear O(n) runtime since this operation is only running n amount of times.
